    "\n",
    "`scikit-learn` is a set of common mathematical and graphical tools used for data mining and data analysis. It is built on the common Python packages `NumPy`, `SciPy`, and `matplotlib`. Using these tools, users can efficiently implement a variety of useful machine learning tools such as classification, regression, clustering and dimenstionality reduction. These techniques are becoming increasingly more relevant for all fields of study and industry as data acquisition technology and methodologies expand in scope and use. The ability to interpret and draw conclusions from data will continue to be sought after in scientific, engineering, and professional fields as time goes on. `scikit-learn` will help us do just that!"
