    "The purpose of these assigments is to practice the topics taught in the `scikit-learn` tutorial. Each question corresponds to a key idea or process outlined in the tutorial notebooks. The goal is to expose students to the concepts introduced and motivate them to do more research into the `scikit-learn` documentation to gain a deeper appreciation of the tools available to them (free of charge!). As such, students will need to do some additional research in order to complete these assignments. It is hoped that this will allow them to get valuable practice both in machine learning and independent research.\n",
